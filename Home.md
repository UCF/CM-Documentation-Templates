Welcome to the {{My Theme}} wiki! This documentation is intended for anyone adding content to a site with this theme activated, and for developers that maintain sites using it.

## About this theme

[[https://github.com/UCF/{{My-Theme}}/raw/master/screenshot.png]]

The {{My Theme}} is a WordPress theme developed by UCF Marketing, intended for {{Who/What? Brief, 1-2 lines}}.

This theme is built using the [Athena Framework](https://ucf.github.io/Athena-Framework/), a front-end web framework that provides mobile-first responsive styles tailored to UCF's brand guidelines.  We strongly recommend that both content editors and developers familiarize themselves with the Athena Framework to better understand this theme and how to style content using it.

### Project goals
{{Outline or explain, in detail, the specific goals and purpose of this theme, and why it exists.  e.g., "This theme was built to provide a consistent look+feel and user experience for UCF's college websites."}}

{{Clarify any expectations or requirements for sites using this theme; e.g. "This theme is designed to be used as-is without extensive customizations, to ensure the consistent experience across all sites using it; the ability to override functionality provided by this theme is limited."}}

### Should I use this theme on my site?
{{Include a description of an intended audience, which ties back into the project's goals.  e.g., "This theme is intended for use by UCF staff who manage web communications for any of UCF's top-level colleges."}}

{{If this theme has a specific, narrow audience, consider referring others to a more generic solution, such as the [UCF WordPress Theme](https://github.com/UCF/UCF-WordPress-Theme/) or a third-party premium theme.}}
